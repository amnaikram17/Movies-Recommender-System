## Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built primarily with Python and Jupyter Notebook. It leverages data processing and similarity algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations. The repository includes all code, data files, and documentation needed to run and understand the system.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on various similarity metrics
- Preprocessed datasets for efficient computation
- Modular and extensible codebase
- Ready-to-use Jupyter notebook for demonstration


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Common libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd Movies_Recommending_System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

3. **Run the notebook:**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `MRS.ipynb` to get started.

## Usage

- Open the `MRS.ipynb` notebook and run the cells in order.
- The notebook contains all logic for loading data, preprocessing, and generating movie recommendations.
- You can modify parameters or datasets as needed to experiment with the system.

## Data

- The `Data/` directory contains datasets used for training and recommendations.
- Pickle files (`*.pkl`) store preprocessed data objects for faster execution.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!  
If you‚Äôd like to collaborate, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
